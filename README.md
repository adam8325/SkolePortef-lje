# Portfolio - Computer Science Education

Welcome to my portfolio! This project was made as a side project to track my progress for this 4. Semester where part of my specialisation evovles around UI/UX design
It is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a focus on **responsive design** and **semantic HTML**. 

## Introduction

This portfolio was created as part of my studies in Computer Science. It demonstrates my ability to build interactive, responsive websites while adhering to modern best practices in web development. 
Have a look at my school portfolio here: https://adams-porteflje.netlify.app/

The portfolio includes:

- **An interactive homepage** with dynamic content.
- **Links to my GitHub**, **LinkedIn**, and **email** in the footer for easy contact.
